Takes text and makes it into an image

<br>
This is a script that both encrypts and decrypts text through the medium of color, written entirely in Python.
<br>
<br>
Prism Cipher is a lightweight, simple script that can encrypt any text file into an image, and decrypt it back again. You can also add as many keys as you need to the cipher in order to make it significantly more difficult to decode, and you can encrypt/decrypt images in any width and height. For example, here's the entire Bee Movie script, encrypted with Prism. Feel free to use my program to decrypt it! No keys were used.

<h2>How to Install</h2>
The setup process, mostly owing to the simplicity of the program, is easy. The program, because it is an image editor, requires <a href=https://pypi.org/project/pillow/>Pillow</a>. You may have to install it using pip if you do not have it already.
<br> <br>
First, download prism.py and place it in its own folder somewhere. If you do not place it in its own folder, it may be difficult to determine where the files it creates are.
<br> <br>
Next, open your preferred terminal and go to the folder you have created (or the folder it is located in) with cd. Then, run it in Python, and you're good to go! Please keep in mind that if you have an outside file that you want to decrypt, you will have to change the selected directory.
