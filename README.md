This is a script that both encrypts and decrypts text through the medium of color, written entirely in Python.

Prism Cipher is a WIP scrip that can encrypt any text file into an image, and decrypt it back again. You can also add as many keys as you need to the cipher in order to make it significantly more difficult to decode, and you can encrypt/decrypt images in any width and height. For example, here's the entire Bee Movie script, encrypted with Prism. Feel free to use my program to decrypt it! No keys were used.
